# Acamedic – The Academic Dictionary

A small Hunspell dictionary for professional, scientific writing. 

* **High Quality:** based on SCOWL en-US dictionary and thoroughly tested.
* **High Sensitivity:** 
	* removed words such as `thee`, `posses`, `fatuous`, or `jerk`.
	* less missed errors (but probably more false-positives)
* **Academic Language:** 
	* added words such as `overapproximation`, `whitepaper`, and `bitmask`.
	* select the scientific domains you need during build
* **Easy Install**: available as extension for LibreOffice and Firefox/Thunderbird.

## Contributing Words
The project is in an early stage and you might find many words in your domain that are missing. Please collect them over time and create an issue with your list of words. Again, the idea is to include only words that you use often or rare words that are very distinct and cannot be confused with other terms.



## Building and Testing
The dictionary is constructed from several individual dictionary files in the `src` folder.

* `/base/` contains common words.
	* `en_US_basic.dic` basic and simple words, e.g. `book`
	* `en_US_extra.dic` generic, formal and abstract, e.g. `interchangeable`
	* `en_US_special.dic` special, more domain specific names that are hard to confuse.
* `/academic/` contains special mathematical, technical, chemical, etc. terms.
* `/names/` contains special names starting with capital letter.
* `/codes/` contains keywords of programming languages.



## Automated Testing
We perform several types of automated tests to ensure a high quality of the dictionary:

* **Correctness:** check if all words in the dictionary are spelled correctly. This is done by looking up all words in a larger dictionary. Some words are open for debate, e.g. whether `testcase` is correct or `test case` should be the only correct spelling.
* **Duplicates:** check if words are encoded twice. This is not a problem for correctness but might indicate some kind of unwanted addition.
* **Coverage:** check which percentage of words of reference articles (e.g. Wikipedia) are included in the dictionary. We aim for high coverage but also intentionally exclude words to improve spell checking of similar words.
* **Consistency:** check if there are inconsistencies with certain grammar rules. E.g. the ending `icly` should in general be `ically`



## Motivation for this Dictionary

For spell checking of academic documents, it is not useful if dictionaries include words such as `thee` or `wee`. They will most likely mask a spelling error of the words `the` or `we`. Since they are archaic or words, probably no one is going to write them but rather read them in some historic text fragments. And even if you write them, a spelling error of these words will most likely be masked by other words because instead of `wee` there is `we`, `see`, or `weed`.

Furthermore, the standard dictionaries include a lot of problematic words, such as `wit`, `dome`, or `wont`.


### Even text analysis tool make mistakes.
Grammarly, for example, can also analyze context and grammar but still does not spot the following spelling error:
`Which refers to the state of keeping some resource secrete from unauthorized parties.`




## Creation Process
I have created this dictionary using the following process:

1. take a very small base dictionary: [SCOWL-20](http://app.aspell.net/create)
2. manually go through it an remove non-scientific terms
3. use it to check reference papers/articles
4. add newly found terms that are in [SCOWL-60](http://app.aspell.net/create)
5. manually check and add further unrecognized terms
6. use the tests to double check all words


#### Terms I have removed
- archaic terms such as `brethren`, `cobbler`, `sod`, `thee`, `thou`, `unto`, `wive`
- inappropriate words such as `cum`, `slut`, `gnome`, `sexy`, `slave`
- narrative adjectives such as `cunning`, `fatuous`, `fierce`, `ghastly`, `hitherto`, `pompous`, `sheer`, `absurd`
- uncommon words with common alternatives, such as `envisage` (use `envision`), `futile` (use `useless`),  or `horrific` (use `horrible`). 
- rare words that are very close to common terms, such as `fist` (too close to `first`)
- colloquial words, such as `eh`, `gig`, `hey`, `lad`, `lousy`, `oh`, `bugger`
- words that are very far away from technical contexts, such as `horde`, `hail`, `hog`, `hut`, `lark`, `mummy`, `bigot`
- religious terms: `heresy`, `sermon`, `sinful`
- words often used to insult: `hypocrite`, `illiterate`, `inane`, `jerk`, `moron`, `snobbery`
- British / Scottish words that sneaked into the US dictionary, such as `lorry`, `nay`, `dole`, `duff`, `dustbin`
- potential mistakes found in SCOWL-20: `cs`, `alias's` (should be `alias'`), also `species's`, `die's`, `elect's`, `feel's`, `want's`

<!-- uncommon with alternatives: `glean`, `greasy`, `havoc` (use `chaos`), `mend` => repair, `smallish` => `small`-->
<!-- - law terms such as `solicitor` -->
<!-- - potential mistakes in SCOWL-95: `uncorrectablely` (search for `ble/[A-Z]*Y`)  -->


### Testing
I do automatic testing on the resulting dictionary file:

- check that there no duplicates or that duplicates are justified, e.g. `clean` can be a verb `clean/SDG` or adjective `clean/YRT`
- run on some reference papers and check that not many words are missing
- check that all words are spelled correctly:
	- using SCOWL-60 and SCOWL-95 dictionary
	- manually double-check all remaining words with 
		- Google
		- [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/)
		- [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com)
		- [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/academic)
<!-- - check that only few words are one edit (typo) away from each other. -->



### Lessons Learned

* the suffixes `-ic` and `-ical` are mostly interchangeable
* words with `-ical` or `-ual` suffix should (normally) have the `/Y` adverb extension.
* words with `-tive` suffix often have `/SYP`
* words should either have `-icity` or `-ness` suffices and these should not have plural forms. E.g. use `simplifications` instead of `simplicities`. 
* words ending in `-ed` very rarely can be negated by prefixing `in-/im-/ir-/il-`





## Future Plan: Part-of-Speech Encoding

The Hunspell compression could be used to indicate the POS type of a word. For example `/SDG` means that either `s`, `ed` or `ing` can be appended to the word, indicating a regular verb. However, the compression is only concerned with the size and therefore it needs to be checked for confusing suffixes.

Misleading expansion examples:

* `we/DGT` expands to `we`, `wed`, `wing`, and `west`
* `be/DT` expands to `be`, `bed`, and `best`
* `should/RZ` expands to `should` and `shoulder/S`

As a result, I started to encode regular verbs with `/SDG` and nouns with `/MS`, adjectives with `/RT` or `/Y` for the adjective/adverb combination.
