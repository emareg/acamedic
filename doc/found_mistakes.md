# Found Mistakes
Here, I will document every mistake that (shortly) slipped into the dictionary, was discovered, and removed.
This list is useful to keep track of the mistake rate and to see how errors get in.

* `icy/RST` => icy has no plural form.
* `trek/SDG` => wrong single "k" (e.g. treking). Correct forms are trekked and trekking
* `spam/MSD` => wrong single "m" (e.g. spamed). Correct forms are spammed and spamming
* `offspring/S` => offspring has no plural form.
* `ransomware/S` => software has no plural form, so ransomware neither.
* `miscommunication/GDS` => is a noun not a verb (probably copy paste error)
* `configurability/AS` => plural form (S) only has 348 Google results and should be excluded
* `schedulability/S` => no plural form
* `coherence/CIS` => probably no plural form. Several papers mention `coherences`.
* `hundred/MS` => should not have a possessive form
* `wireless/MDSYP` => should not have a possessive form

<!-- * `inheterogeneity` => the opposite of heterogeneity is homogeneity -->
