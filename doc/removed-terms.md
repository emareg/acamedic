# Removed Terms 

The following is an incomplete list of terms I have removed from the original small SCOWL-20 dictionary.


- archaic terms such as `brethren`, `cobbler`, `sod`, `thee`, `thou`, `unto`, `wive`
- inappropriate words such as `cum`, `slut`, `gnome`, `sexy`, `slave`
- narrative adjectives such as `cunning`, `fatuous`, `fierce`, `ghastly`, `hitherto`, `pompous`, `sheer`
- uncommon words with common alternatives, such as `envisage` (use `envision`), `futile` (use `useless`),  or `horrific` (use `horrible`). 
- colloquial words such as `eh`, `gig`, `hey`, `lad`, `lousy`, `oh`, `bugger`
- words that are very far away from technical contexts, such as `horde`, `hail`, `hog`, `hut`, `lark`, `mummy`, `bigot`
- religious terms such as `heresy`, `sermon`, `sinful`
- words often used to insult: `hypocrite`, `illiterate`, `inane`, `jerk`, `moron`, `snobbery`
- British / Scottish words that sneaked into the US dictionary, such as `lorry`, `nay`, `dole`, `duff`, `dustbin`
- potential mistakes found in SCOWL-20: `cs`, `alias's` (should be `alias'`), also `species's`, `die's`, `elect's`, `feel's`, `want's`
