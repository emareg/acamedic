# Typo Friends
Similar to `false friends`, these are word pairs that can easily be misused.
The following generated list shows words that only differ by one character.
The two versions of that character belong keyboard keys that are directly next to each other on a standard US/DE keyboard and can thus easily be mistyped.
For example, `f` and `t` are key neighbors and have a similar visual appearance, which makes the difference difficult to spot. 
The goal is to keep this list small and exclude one word of each Typo Friend from Acamedic when reasonable.
