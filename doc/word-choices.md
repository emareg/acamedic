# Explanation of Spelling Variants

This file documents different spelling variants I came across and gives a preference for each.

The preference is selected according to the following order:

1. Academic convention (use in papers and Wikipedia)
2. Modern US spelling according to US dictionaries
2. Old US spelling according to US dictionaries
4. Any British spelling.



## Aluminium vs. Aluminum
Short: use `aluminium`

While Aluminum is the US spelling, Aluminium is used everywhere else (including Academia) and is consistent with the `-ium` suffixes of elements. Therefore, we only include `aluminium`.


## Therefore vs. Therefor
Short: use `therefore` if it is not a legal context.

Explanation: Both are valid adverbs. `Therefore` means “as a consequence” or “hence”, while `therefor` means “for that” or “for it” and is used in legal documents.


## Approximately vs. approximatively
Short: both are valid but prefer `approximately`

Explanation: `Approximately` is the adverb of the verb `approximate`. Otherwise it is the adverb of `approximative`, which is derived from `approximation`.

## Latency vs. Latence
Short: use `latency`

Explanation: `latence` is the obsolete form. Derived from French?


## Indexes vs Indices
Short: it depends

"Indices" is used when referring to mathematical, scientific and statistical contexts.
"Indexes" is usually used in reference to written documents, such as bibliographical or citation listings.


## Formulas vs. Formulae and Matrices vs. Matrixes
Short: use `formulae` and `matrices`

Formulae is the formal plural for the latin word `formula`. However, `formulas` is also correct since `formula` is considered an English word now.


## Hierarchical vs. Hierarchic
Short: it depends.

While -ic is much more common overall (and could be argued to be the "default"), `-ical` is strongly preferred in stems ending in `-(o)log-`. 

* prefer `biological` over `biologic`
* prefer `technological` over `technologic`
* prefer `typological` over `typologic`
* prefer `theoretical` over `theoretic` (however, there is a "number theoretic transformation")


On the other side, there are words where you should prefer the `-ic` suffix:

* prefer `traumatic` over `traumatical`
* prefer `simplistic` over `simplistical`


## Parametrize vs. Parameterize
Short: you probably `parametrize` 

Explanation: something is made `parametric` (uses `parameters`) by `parametrization`. Otherwise it is converted into a `parameter` by `parameterization`.

## Acknowledgment or Acknowledgement
Short: use `Acknowledgment`

The spelling without the 'e' is favored in the U.S. and Canada, the spelling with the 'e', in Britain and Australia. Furthermore, the term `Judgment` with the same suffix is spelled without the 'e' in both British and American English.


## Secret vs. Secrete
Short: use `secret` if you mean `hidden`, `secrete` if you mean `liquid`.

Explanation: `Secrete` is a rare verb form of `secret` but much more common in biology as a noun meaning a liquid released by plants or animals. If you want to express secret as a verb, prefer `conceal` or `hide`.



## Exclusiveness or Exclusivity
Short: it depends... use `Exclusivity`


## connectible or connectable


## gray vs. grey
Short: use `gray`


## collectible vs. collectable
Short: use `collectible`

Collectable is an alternative spelling of the same word but more frequent in British english.


## "life cycle" vs. "lifecycle", vs. "life-cycle"
Short: use `life cycle`

Several terms slowly transition from two words to a one-word form. E.g. "whitepaper" or "microservice" is accepted.
